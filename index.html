<h1>Janarkush: The Song of the Mountains</h1>
<p><em>An animated legend of harmony, courage, and the song that saved a world.</em></p>
<p><strong>Inspired by Kyrgyz mythology.</strong></p>
<hr/>

<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
<p>
When an ancient evil sorcerer rises to silence the mythical bird Janarkush and plunge the world into imbalance,
twin brothers must overcome their fears and differences to protect their family and the natural harmony.
</p>
<p>
They face betrayal, curses, and magical forces — and in the end, transform a cursed creation into a sacred musical instrument
that brings healing instead of destruction.
</p>

<h2 id="characters">Main Characters</h2>
<h3>Kambar</h3>
<p>A noble Kyrgyz hunter and guardian of nature. Calm, wise and courageous. He carries a golden-feathered arrow and believes that true power comes from harmony with the natural world.</p>

<h3>Aksuu & Koksuu</h3>
<p>Twin brothers with opposite energies. Aksuu is agile, cheerful and full of curiosity. Koksuu is calm, observant, and slower in movement — but deeply loyal. Together, they learn that harmony comes not from sameness, but from unity.</p>

<h2>Antagonists</h2>
<h3>Ka’ar</h3>
<p>A once-banished sorcerer who feeds on fear and despair. He seeks to destroy Janarkush and silence all harmony. Mysterious, terrifying, but not invincible.</p>

<h3>Kashan</h3>
<p>A flashy, manipulative witch — comical in appearance but dangerous in intent. She embodies Laziness and lures others into passivity and false comfort.</p>

<h3>Ka’ar’s Servants</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Jeztirmak</strong> — Seduction with claws.</li>
  <li><strong>Choyunbash</strong> — Strength without mind.</li>
  <li><strong>Jelmoguz</strong> — The fallen warrior.</li>
  <li><strong>Kuzkun</strong> — The watcher in the sky.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supporting Characters</h2>
<h3>Janarkush</h3>
<p>A mythical bird of light and memory. She sees through illusion and inspires truth. Her song awakens harmony, not destruction.</p>

<h3>Aysal</h3>
<p>The boys’ mother. Strong, graceful, and deeply connected to nature. Even when cursed, her wisdom continues to guide her sons.</p>

<h2>Symbolic Guardians</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Kamabarkan Ata</strong> — Spirit of the Horsekeepers. He teaches balance through motion, trust without words, and strength born from care.</li>
  <li><strong>Cholpon Ata</strong> — Spirit of the Shepherds. He walks behind the flock, not in front.</li>
  <li><strong>Dekhan Baba</strong> — Spirit of the Farmers. His strength is quiet and deep, like the roots he guards.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visual World</h2>
<p>
The visual style of Janarkush blends poetic animation with cultural realism. It draws from Kyrgyz mountain landscapes,
traditional dress, and mythological textures — creating a timeless but emotionally grounded world.
</p>

<h2>Key Locations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Forest Clearing</strong> — Where the family lives and harmony is remembered.</li>
  <li><strong>Cliff of Echoes</strong> — Where truths are revealed, and heroes fall.</li>
  <li><strong>Forest of Separation</strong> — Where brothers part ways — and destiny takes root.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why This Story Matters</h2>
<p>
In a world flooded with violence and cynicism, Janarkush tells a different tale — where courage is quiet, harmony is heroic,
and healing comes through music, not weapons. This story was born from a grandmother’s voice, passed down and reshaped for a new generation.
</p>

<h2>Our Cultural Voice</h2>
<p>
The komuz, the kalpak, the tunduk — these are not decorations. They are living codes. Symbols of Kyrgyz identity and creativity that deserve to be seen and celebrated beyond borders.
</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>
Janarkush is more than a story — it’s a cultural voice. In a global animation industry dominated by Western and East Asian stories,
this project brings Central Asian mythology to the screen for the first time.
</p>

<h2>Join Us</h2>
<p>
We are looking for producers, co-production studios, and development labs who believe in powerful storytelling and cultural diversity.
