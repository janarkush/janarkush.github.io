  <h2>Antagonists</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ka’ar</strong> — A once-banished sorcerer who feeds on fear and despair. He seeks to destroy Janarkush and silence all harmony. Mysterious, terrifying, but not invincible.</li>

  <h2>Visual World</h2>
  <p>The visual style of Janarkush blends poetic animation with cultural realism. It draws from Kyrgyz mountain landscapes, traditional dress, and mythological textures — creating a timeless but emotionally grounded world.</p>

  <h2>Key Locations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Forest Clearing</strong> — A sacred meadow surrounded by tall trees and yurts. Where the family lives and harmony is remembered.</li>
    <li><strong>Cliff of Echoes</strong> — A place of reckoning. Where truths are revealed, and heroes fall.</li>
    <li><strong>Forest of Separation</strong> — A dark pine forest. Where brothers part ways — and destiny takes root.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Why This Story Matters</h2>
  <p>In a world flooded with violence and cynicism, Janarkush tells a different tale — where courage is quiet, harmony is heroic, and healing comes through music, not weapons.</p>

  <h2>Our Cultural Voice</h2>
  <p>Janarkush is not a museum story. It’s living folklore — reshaped for today, carried by music, and rooted in the values of one of the world’s oldest cultures.</p>
  <p>The komuz, the kalpak, the tunduk — these are not decorations. They are living codes. Symbols of Kyrgyz identity and creativity that deserve to be seen, heard, and celebrated beyond borders.</p>
  <p>We believe that animation can carry memory. And that stories from the mountains of Central Asia can sit proudly beside legends from every corner of the world.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>Janarkush is more than a story — it’s a cultural voice. In a global animation industry dominated by Western and East Asian stories, this project brings Central Asian mythology to the screen for the first time.</p>
  <p>Through the music of the komuz, the image of the kalpak, and the wisdom of a mythical bird, Janarkush shares the emotional heritage of the Kyrgyz people — a story of harmony, balance, and memory.</p>
  <p>We believe that even small cultures carry epic truths. And that animation can be a bridge, not just a spectacle.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Join Us</h2>
  <p>We are looking for producers, co-production studios, and development labs who believe in powerful storytelling and cultural diversity.</p>
  <p>The script is complete. The visuals are in place. The story is ready to fly — it just needs the right wings.</p>
  <p>If you’re seeking a unique animated feature rooted in mythology, ecology, and emotion — Janarkush is open for collaboration.</p>
