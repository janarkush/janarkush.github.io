  <h1>Janarkush: The Song of the Mountains</h1>
  <p><em>An animated legend of harmony, courage, and the song that saved a world.</em></p>
  <p><strong>Inspired by Kyrgyz mythology.</strong></p>

  <hr>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>
When an ancient evil sorcerer rises to silence the mythical bird Janarkush and plunge the world into imbalance, twin brothers must overcome their fears and differences to protect their family and the natural harmony.
</p>
<p>
They face betrayal, curses, and magical forces â€” and in the end, transform a cursed creation into a sacred musical instrument that brings healing instead of destruction.
</p>

<h2>Main Characters</h2>

<h3>Kambar</h3>
<p>A noble Kyrgyz hunter and guardian of nature. Calm, wise and courageous. He carries a golden-feathered arrow and believes that true power comes from harmony with the natural world.</p>

<h3>Aksuu & Koksuu</h3>
<p>
Twin brothers with opposite energies.  
<strong>Aksuu</strong> is agile, cheerful and full of curiosity.  
<strong>Koksuu</strong> is calm, observant, and slower in movement â€” but deeply loyal.  
Together, they learn that harmony comes not from sameness, but from unity.

</p>

<h3>Key Locations</h3>

<ul style="list-style-type:none; padding-left:0;">
  <li><strong>Forest Clearing</strong> â€” A sacred meadow surrounded by tall trees and yurts. Where the family lives and harmony is remembered.</li>
  <li><strong>Cliff of Echoes</strong> â€” A place of reckoning. Where truths are revealed, and heroes fall.</li>
  <li><strong>Forest of Separation</strong> â€” A dark pine forest. Where brothers part ways â€” and destiny takes root.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why This Story Matters</h2>

<p>
In a world flooded with violence and cynicism, Janarkush tells a different tale â€” where courage is quiet, harmony is heroic, and healing comes through music, not weapons.
</p>

<p>
It reminds us that strength doesnâ€™t mean destruction. That memory can protect.  
That kindness â€” even when threatened â€” is not weakness.
</p>

<p>
This story was born from a grandmotherâ€™s voice, passed down and reshaped for a new generation.  
It carries the heartbeat of a people â€” and the hope that children everywhere will grow up believing in creation, not conquest.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Our Cultural Voice</h2>

<p>
Janarkush is not a museum story. Itâ€™s living folklore â€” reshaped for today, carried by music, and rooted in the values of one of the worldâ€™s oldest cultures.
</p>

<p>
The komuz, the kalpak, the tunduk â€” these are not decorations. They are living codes. Symbols of Kyrgyz identity and creativity that deserve to be seen, heard, and celebrated beyond borders.
</p>

<p>
We believe that animation can carry memory. And that stories from the mountains of Central Asia can sit proudly beside legends from every corner of the world.

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>
Janarkush is more than a story â€” itâ€™s a cultural voice. In a global animation industry dominated by Western and East Asian stories, this project brings Central Asian mythology to the screen for the first time.
</p>
<p>
Through the music of the <strong>komuz</strong>, the image of the <strong>kalpak</strong>, and the wisdom of a mythical bird, Janarkush shares the emotional heritage of the Kyrgyz people â€” a story of harmony, balance, and memory.
</p>
<p>
We believe that even small cultures carry epic truths. And that animation can be a bridge, not just a spectacle.
</p>
<hr>

<h2>Join Us</h2>
<p>
We are looking for producers, co-production studios, and development labs who believe in powerful storytelling and cultural diversity.
</p>
<p>
The script is complete. The visuals are in place. The story is ready to fly â€” it just needs the right wings.
</p>
<p>
If youâ€™re seeking a unique animated feature rooted in mythology, ecology, and emotion â€” <strong>Janarkush</strong> is open for collaboration.
