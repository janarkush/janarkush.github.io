<h2>Our Cultural Voice</h2>
<p>Janarkush is not a museum story. It’s living folklore — reshaped for today, carried by music, and rooted in the values of one of the world’s oldest cultures.</p>
<p>The komuz, the kalpak, the tunduk — these are not decorations. They are living codes. Symbols of Kyrgyz identity and creativity that deserve to be seen, heard, and celebrated beyond borders.</p>
<p>We believe that animation can carry memory. And that stories from the mountains of Central Asia can sit proudly beside legends from every corner of the world.</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>Janarkush is more than a story — it’s a cultural voice. In a global animation industry dominated by Western and East Asian stories, this project brings Central Asian mythology to the screen for the first time.</p>
<p>Through the music of the komuz, the image of the kalpak, and the wisdom of a mythical bird, Janarkush shares the emotional heritage of the Kyrgyz people — a story of harmony, balance, and memory.</p>
<p>We believe that even small cultures carry epic truths. And that animation can be a bridge, not just a spectacle.</p>

<h2>Join Us</h2>
<p>We are looking for producers, co-production studios, and development labs who believe in powerful storytelling and cultural diversity.</p>
<p>The script is complete. The visuals are in place. The story is ready to fly — it just needs the right wings.</p>
<p>If you’re seeking a unique animated feature rooted in mythology, ecology, and emotion — Janarkush is open for collaboration.</p>
